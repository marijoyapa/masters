            BUG

Error 404, here we go again
been my 20th try, yet the page still crashing
tired now, so what is it this time?
its frustrating, caused by just few lines

i tried to look inward to see what I missed
but this bug feels like an endless abyss
it's not just a flaw, it's a puzzle to chase
an error of thinking, I put in the first place

this scenario's unique, one hell of an edge case
you, fave bug, appears without a trace
thought you'd be a good feature, yet a buggy one
now I must tread with caution, till this issue's done

i encountered you before, I recall that day,
a quick refresh made you go away
now I'm stuck in this debugging ballet,
trying to figure out why you won't sway

debugging, deleting where do i begin?
you're elusive, a puzzle I can't win
you never spoke to me, not a single clue
just tell me its my fault, that will do

Ah, there you are, my favorite bug!
on the 27th attempt, i found your log
i admit, you're a challenge, a complex thug
but i'll miss this hunt, like a cozy hug

and now im writing a few lines of code 
hoping that this version will not implode
oh bug, you force me to constantly improve
now version 8.27 is ready for next episode
